        PURPLE handled the event planning as well as on-site event management. With the client, we handled the ideation process, the guest list, managing the vendors and day-to-day planning. The event included a cocktail reception where guests enjoyed live music provided by a Juilliard quartet followed by a dinner hosted by Lydia Fenet, a well-known auctioneer at Christieâ€™s Auction House. Guests were then escorted to the Engelhard Court via an interactive OMV Tunnel entrance. The dinner sequence opened with a speech by Lydia Fenet, followed by Sir Fraser Stoddart and Celine Talabaza, CEO of Girl Up Foundation. After the dinner, guests were gifted with Noble Panacea products - the Brilliant and Absolute Collection.
